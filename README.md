## Lab 1: Homopolar (aka goofy) Motor 

### Introduction
A homopolar motor is a direct current (DC) electric motor that consists of an assembly of a current-carrying copper wire, AA battery and permanent magnets forming a complete circuit that produces a constant rotational motion. This spinning movement is due to an electromagnetic force called the Lorentz Force. The Lorentz force occurs as a result of electrical current passing through the magnetic field of the magnet which is exerted on the copper wire causing it to spin. 

### Hypothesis
- Increasing the number of magnets increases the speed of the motor (speed defined as rate at which the motor rotates)
- The motor will overheat if left spinning for a while
- The thicker the wire the slower the motor will run 

### Materials
- a spring-loaded punch
- a AA battery
- 2 mm thick x 15 mm diameter magnets 
- 16 and 18 AWG copper wire
- one aluminum disk
- double stick tape
- Kapton tape

### Methods
First, a spring-punch was used to puncture the positive terminal of an AA battery and create an indentation to ensure that the copper wire does not fall off as it rotated. The ends of an 18 AWG insulated copper wire ( length of ~20 cm) were stripped of their insulated material using an exacto knife and a flat surface to allow for current flow through the wire. The stripped copper wire was bent into an open-ended rectangular frame with a small dip at its summit. The small dip (where the rectangular structure made contact with the positive terminal of the battery) was also stripped. Two magnets were placed below the negative terminal of the battery and the copper structure was mantled on the battery. The stripped dip was laid on the indentation of the battery and the stripped ends were bent on vertical opposite ends of the battery to form a complete circuit. Finally, the copper wire was lightly nudged and prompted its spinning. 

### Further Testing
The following motor configurations (varying in wire shape, wire diameters, number of magnets, and conditions) were tested:
- Rectangular wireframe, 18 AWG wire, two magnets
- Rectangular wireframe, 16 AWG wire, two magnets
- Rectangular wireframe, 18 AWG wire, four magnets
- Rectangular wireframe, 18 AWG wire, four magnets, more distance between the wireframe and battery 
- Rectangular wireframe, 16 AWG wire, four magnets
- Coil wireframe, 18 AWG, two magnets
- Coil wireframe, 16 AWG, two magnets 
- Rectangular wireframe, 18 AWG wire, two magnets, air drag 
- Rectangular wireframe, 18 AWG wire, two magnets, friction

### Observations and Analysis
Two similar rectangular copper wire structures with the same amount of magnets (two) but differing wire diameters (16 AWG and 18 AWG) were observed. The motor that used the wire with the higher diameter (16 AWG) spun at a slower rate than the motor that used a wire with a lower diameter (18 AWG). This may be due to the fact that the lower AWG value the more current it can draw from the supply and because torque increases with current while speed and torque are inversely proportional a thicker wire decreases the speed of the motor. The same behavior was observed in the two motors with coil frame wires but differing AWG. Amongst all the motors, despite varying frame geometry, one observation remained the same: the more magnets added to the motor the higher the speed of the motor. This may be due to an increase in magnetic strength resulting in an increase of magnetic force per amp of current flow. We found that a motor with a rectangular frame with a relatively small length parameter (width side of rectangle near battery), 18 AWG wire, and four magnets spun a lot faster than a rectangular structure with the same AWG, magnet number, but greater length parameter (elongated horizontally and thus farther from the battery). We also found that when introduced with any amount of air drag (generated via attaching a piece of tape at the end of the wire or waving a notebook in the opposing spinning direction), many of the motor configurations displayed a significant decrease in rotation speed and often stopped spinning altogether. It was significantly more difficult to prompt a coil wire motor into running than a rectangular wire motor, likely due to the difficulties involved in bending wire into a reasonably symmetrical, balanced coil that prevents the spinning wire from losing balance, breaking electrical flow, and stop spinning. A balanced copper frame was key to maintaining a connection at the punctured end of the battery and permanent magnet underneath that drives current flow through the motor and produces the Lorentz force that causes the circular motion of the wire. The wire and battery became hot after operating for a while.

### Conclusions 
Based off these observations, we can deduce that in a homopolar motor:
- A thicker wire indicates a higher current capacity and more current equals more torque which decreases speed
- Increasing the number of magnets increases the magnetic field which increases the motor speed
- An imbalance in the center of gravity of the wire frame introduces more friction at the points where the wire ends hang from resulting in a halt in rotations (often also pulling the top off the positive terminal of the battery) 
- The greater the distance between the wire and the battery (its center of rotation) the slower the speed of the motor due to its higher inertia (resistance to motion)
- Air drag presents a significant resistance to speed in such a low power motor
- The motor becomes hot after continuous operation
